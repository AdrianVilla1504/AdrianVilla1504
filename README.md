## Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Adrian Villa

I am a developer with skills in analysis, autonomy, initiative, teamwork, and problem-solving. I have a good level of English and knowledge of the *Javascript/Typescript* language, with experience using the *MERN* stack, *version control* with git, and managing *Npm packages*, among other things.

*Experience has taught me how to solve problems and make things happen in my career as well as outside of it.*
