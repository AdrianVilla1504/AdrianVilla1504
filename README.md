# Hi
# ðŸ‘‹ My name is Adrian Villa

I am a developer with skills in analysis, autonomy, initiative, teamwork, and problem-solving. I have a good level of English and knowledge of the *Javascript/Typescript* language, with experience using the *MERN* stack, *version control* with git, and managing *Npm packages*, among other things.

*Experience has taught me how to solve problems and make things happen in my career as well as outside of it.*

I am a person who enjoys and is grateful for the essential things in life, such as good health, and spending time with my family, partner, and friends. Going out to eat at a restaurant or taking a walk in a park or beautiful place while having a conversation for hours is my preferred way to spend my free time.
